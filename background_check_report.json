      "output": "Based on the analysis of the Kerberus website and the content scraped from their \"Terms of Use\" and \"Privacy Policy\" pages, here is the due diligence summary focused on identifying the legal entities:\n\n### **Legal Entity Identification**\n\nThe primary legal entity associated with the Kerberus project has been identified:\n\n1.  **Company Name (Explicitly Mentioned):** **Kerberus Cyber Security, Inc.**\n    *   **Source:** Mentioned as the owner and operator of the Service in the **Terms of Use** and as the entity responsible for privacy in the **Privacy Policy**.\n    *   **Copyright Notice:** The website footer also lists: \"© 2025 Kerberus Cyber Security, Inc.\"\n\n2.  **Jurisdiction/Registration (Suggested but Not Confirmed by Text):**\n    *   While the name suggests a U.S. corporation (Inc.), the actual jurisdiction or registered address is **not explicitly stated** in the provided text excerpts. Further external investigation or access to the full legal documents would be necessary to confirm the jurisdiction (e.g., Delaware, Wyoming, etc.) and registration number.\n\n### **Other Relevant Entities Mentioned**\n\nThe documents also mention third-party entities in specific contexts:\n\n*   **Fairside:** This entity is mentioned as the third-party partner providing the **financial protection/Coverage** of up to \\$30,000. Their website is listed as `www.fairside.io`. This indicates a contractual relationship for insurance/indemnification risk transfer.\n*   **Payment Agents/Service Providers:** The Terms of Use state that Kerberus *may* use **third parties (affiliated to Kerberus or otherwise)** as paying agents to collect fees. The specific identity of these agents is not named, only that Kerberus remains responsible for their performance.\n\n### **Conclusion on Legal Entities**\n\nThe core operating entity for the product (Sentinel3 Pro extension) is **Kerberus Cyber Security, Inc.**\n\nTo proceed with a full background check, the next steps would be to:\n1.  Search for the corporate registration details of **Kerberus Cyber Security, Inc.** to determine its jurisdiction, UBOs, and history.\n2.  Investigate the partner **Fairside** to assess their credibility and the terms of the coverage agreement.",
