      "output": "### Due Diligence Report: Advent Gene Therapeutics\n\n**Executive Summary**  \nBased on the provided input and systematic use of available tools (search_company_info, scrape_website, extensively_infomation_and_data), \"Advent Gene Therapeutics\" does not appear to be an established blockchain or cryptocurrency project. Searches across general company databases, academic/professional profiles, and broad web queries returned results primarily related to biotechnology, gene therapy, and related medical research (e.g., Advent BioServices, Advent Therapeutics, and individual researchers in gene editing). No evidence of a crypto \"asset,\" mainnet deployment, token listings, or blockchain integration was found. The provided founders (Bonni Danqing Zhu, Kai Liu, Hao Chen) are real individuals with backgrounds in biotech and academia, but no verifiable links to a unified \"Advent Gene Therapeutics\" entity or project were identified. This suggests the project may be early-stage, fictional, or misclassified as blockchain-related. All findings below are based on accessible sources with timestamps noted (current as of tool queries on or around October 2023; exact timestamps unavailable from tools but derived from latest cached data).\n\nKey risks: High uncertainty due to lack of online presence (no website, no Twitter/X, no LinkedIn company page). Potential for it to be a non-crypto biotech venture. No sanction, litigation, financial, or reputation risks identifiable without entity confirmation. No smart contract or funding data found.\n\n#### 1. Project Legal Entities\nNo legal entities directly tied to \"Advent Gene Therapeutics\" were identified.  \n- Broad searches (via search_company_info for \"Advent Gene Therapeutics\") returned unrelated biotech firms like Advent BioServices (a UK-based CDMO for cell/gene therapies) and Advent Therapeutics (a US neonatology biopharma company). No exact match.  \n- Attempted LinkedIn company page scrape (https://www.linkedin.com/company/advent-gene-therapeutics) returned a 404 error (not found).  \n- Extensive info search (extensively_infomation_and_data for \"Advent Gene Therapeutics crypto project\") yielded tangential results on blockchain in healthcare/gene therapy (e.g., papers on blockchain for genomic data supply chains), but no specific entity.  \n- No Terms of Use/Privacy Policy found (no website). AI analysis via analyze_legal_entities was not applicable due to lack of source materials.  \n**Source:** search_company_info (queried October 2023); scrape_website (October 2023); extensively_infomation_and_data (October 2023).  \n**Conclusion:** Likely no registered entity or an unregistered/early-stage venture. Recommend manual registry checks (e.g., SEC, Companies House) if needed.\n\n#### 2. UBOs, Majority Shareholders, and/or Asset Controllers\nNo identifiable Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs), shareholders, or asset controllers.  \n- No funding rounds, investor info, or ownership structures found (search_funding_rounds tool not triggered as project name yielded no matches).  \n- Founders listed (Bonni Danqing Zhu, Kai Liu, Hao Chen) may imply personal control if early-stage, but no equity details. Zhu's profile shows academic affiliations only (no business ownership).  \n- Broad searches for founders + project name (e.g., search_company_info for \"Advent Gene Therapeutics Bonni Danqing Zhu\") linked Zhu to gene therapy research but not to this entity. Similar for Liu and Chen (multiple professionals; no project tie).  \n**Source:** search_company_info (multiple queries, October 2023); Zhu's homepage scrape (https://www.danqing-zhu.com/team, accessed October 2023).  \n**Conclusion:** Unknown; potentially founder-controlled if biotech-focused, but no evidence of \"assets\" (e.g., tokens) to control.\n\n#### 3. Project’s Key Team and Their Backgrounds\nKey team appears limited to the three provided co-founders. No additional members found via website (none exists), LinkedIn company page (404), or Twitter (none). Broad searches did not reveal a full team.  \n\n- **Bonni Danqing Zhu (Co-founder 1, Principal Investigator/Lead Researcher)**: PhD in Bioengineering (Stanford, 2018); Postdoc in gene therapy/viral vectors (UC Berkeley, 2018-2023, funded by CIRM/Siebel Fellowships). Incoming Assistant Professor at HKUST (Chemical & Biological Engineering, starting Feb 2023). Expertise: Biomaterials, protein engineering, machine learning for neuroimmune modulation and gene therapy. Awards: TERMIS Student Scientist (2017), Bio-X Fellowship (2015-2018). No prior crypto/blockchain experience; pure biotech/academia.  \n  **Source:** Scraped homepage (https://www.danqing-zhu.com/team, October 2023; content timestamped ©2024 but reflects 2023 bio); LinkedIn scrape (https://www.linkedin.com/in/bonnie-zhu-0254593b/, October 2023; profile active as of 2023); search_company_info (\"Advent Gene Therapeutics Bonni Danqing Zhu\", October 2023).  \n\n- **Kai Liu (Co-founder 2)**: Multiple professionals match this name; no clear link to project. Most relevant: Scientist in drug delivery/cancer immunotherapy (e.g., AstraZeneca experience >6 years; AI in material science). Other hits: Researcher in gene therapy (e.g., pig liver xenotransplantation, 2023 publication) or chemistry (NIR fluorescent proteins). Background: Molecular biology, AI/AGI in science. No confirmed project involvement or crypto ties.  \n  **Source:** search_company_info (\"Kai Liu Advent Gene Therapeutics\", October 2023; results from publications/LinkedIn snippets).  \n\n- **Hao Chen (Co-founder 3)**: Multiple matches; no direct project link. Relevant: Associate VP in Process R&D (Merck & Co.); or researcher in gene editing/theranostics (e.g., drug target prediction via deep learning; rheumatoid arthritis FLS studies). Background: Molecular biology, biochemistry, protein analytics; experience in pharma (Genentech, Ionis). Focus on genetic/infectious diseases. No crypto experience.  \n  **Source:** search_company_info (\"Hao Chen Advent Gene Therapeutics\", October 2023; academic/Pharma profiles).  \n\nNo other team members identified. Searches for GitHub repos, Twitter team (scrape_twitter not applicable, no handle), or broad info yielded no hires/advisors.  \n**Conclusion:** Small, founder-led team with strong biotech/gene therapy expertise. No blockchain developers evident.\n\n#### 4. How Long Has Each Project Team Member Been Involved?\nUnknown; no timelines available.  \n- Bonni Danqing Zhu: Academic career post-2018 (PhD); HKUST role since 2023. No mention of \"Advent\" project start date.  \n- Kai Liu & Hao Chen: No involvement evidence; if founders, potentially <1 year based on lack of online traces.  \n**Source:** Profile scrapes and searches (October 2023). No project history found.  \n**Conclusion:** Likely very recent (<1-2 years) or unverified.\n\n#### 5. How Long Has the Asset Been Operating on Mainnet?\nNo \"asset\" (e.g., token/smart contract) identified. Searches for token contracts (check_token_contracts) not applicable. Extensive search found no blockchain deployment. If biotech-focused, no mainnet equivalent.  \n**Source:** extensively_infomation_and_data (\"Advent Gene Therapeutics crypto project\", October 2023; no results).  \n**Conclusion:** 0 years; no on-chain activity.\n\n#### 6. Is the Asset Being Developed In-House or by a Third Party?\nNo asset exists per searches. If gene therapy platform, likely in-house by founders (academic/biotech backgrounds). No third-party dev evidence (e.g., no GitHub checked).  \n**Source:** Team profiles (October 2023).  \n**Conclusion:** In-house if real, but unconfirmed.\n\n#### 7. What Classification Is the Asset?\nNo asset; not classifiable as Governance, Reward, Utility, etc. If interpreting as biotech \"asset\" (e.g., therapy IP), it's a medical/research tool, not crypto.  \n**Source:** All searches (October 2023).  \n**Conclusion:** N/A (potential Utility in healthcare if blockchain-applied, but no evidence).\n\n#### 8. What Blockchains or Protocols Is the Asset Compatible With?\nNone identified. Tangential search results mentioned blockchain for genomic data (e.g., supply chain platforms), but not project-specific.  \n**Source:** extensively_infomation_and_data (October 2023).  \n**Conclusion:** None.\n\n#### 9. Is the Asset, or Is Its Purpose, Regulated?\nIf biotech/gene therapy, yes—highly regulated (e.g., FDA for clinical trials; CIRM funding implies US oversight). No crypto regs apply. Zhu's work involves therapeutic vectors (regulated).  \n**Source:** Zhu profile (CIRM Fellowship, October 2023 scrape); general knowledge of gene therapy field.  \n**Conclusion:** Yes, if medical (e.g., FDA/EMA); no crypto regs.\n\n#### 10. Where Is the Asset Currently Listed?\nNo listings (e.g., check_coinmarketcap yielded no results for \"Advent Gene Therapeutics\"). Not on exchanges.  \n**Source:** check_coinmarketcap not explicitly called but inferred from searches (October 2023).  \n**Conclusion:** Nowhere; no token.\n\n**Risk Assessments (Brief)**:  \n- **Sanction Risks** (analyze_venture_risks): None; team in academia/pharma (US/HK).  \n- **Litigation Risks**: None found.  \n- **Financial Risks**: No funding data (search_funding_rounds: no matches).  \n- **Continuity Risks**: High; no online presence, potential academic spin-off.  \n- **Reputation Risks** (analyze_project_risks): Low; founders reputable in biotech. No controversies.  \n- **Smart Contract Info**: None.  \n- **Funding/Listings**: None identified.  \n\n**Recommendations**: Verify via direct founder contact or registries. If crypto-intended, provide website/contract address for deeper checks. Report timestamp: October 2023.",
