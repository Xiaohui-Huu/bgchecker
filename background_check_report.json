The legal entity information from the full agreements cannot be reliably extracted without their content.\n\n**Next Steps:**\nTo get a complete picture, I would need to successfully scrape the content of the **Terms of Use** and **Privacy Policy** documents, which are usually linked from the footer, to find more detailed corporate and jurisdictional information.",
